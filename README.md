Application to measure the leaflet lengths of the mitral valve before and during a clipping procedure. Additional features facilitate patient selection by providing automated measurements for diverse anatomic structures (eg. closure line heigth, MVOA, coaptation area).
Main logic for the measurements can be found in mpr_slicer and leaflet_graph.
